## Purpose and Scope

1. The purpose of this policy is to define the procedures to assess and treat information security risks within the organization, and to define the acceptable level of risk overall.
2. Risk assessment and risk treatment are applied to the entire scope of the organization’s information security program, and to all information systems which are used within the organization or which could have an impact on the organization’s information security.
3. This policy applies to all management and employees that take part in the organization’s risk assessments. This policy must be made readily available to all whom it applies to.

## Background

1. This policy defines a step-by-step process for conducting risk assessments, as well as to treat identified risks from an information security perspective. This policy also describes how to prepare the Risk Assessment Report required as part of the risk assessment process.
2. When conducting a risk assessment, the organization must identify all organizational information systems. It must then identify all threats and vulnerabilities having to do with such systems, and rate the severity of such threats and vulnerabilities according to a predefined rating scale. Asset and risk owners must be defined for each risk item.
3. Once the risk assessment is completed, the organization shall determine how to manage risks where the overall assessed risk rating is deemed as too high. This management is known as risk treatment. Risk treatment options include but are not limited to applying security controls, outsourcing risk, accepting risk, or discontinuing the activity associated with the risk.
4. A penetration test must be performed by a third party to verify the accuracy of the risk assessment and effectiveness of deployed risk treatments.

## Procedure to Execute Risk Assessment Report

1. Confirm that the entire risk assessment and risk treatment process has been carried out according to the Risk Assessment Policy.
2. The purpose of the risk assessment is to identify all information systems, their vulnerabilities, and threats that could exploit vulnerabilities. These parameters are further evaluated to establish the criticality of individual risks.
3. The purpose of the risk treatment is to define the systematic means of reducing or controlling the risks identified in the risk assessment.
4. All risk assessment and treatment activities must be completed within the scope of the organization’s information security program.
5. The risk assessment must be implemented in the period from [day/month/year] to [day/month/year]. The risk treatment must be implemented from [day/month/year] to [day/month/year]. Final reports must be prepared during [specify period].
6. The risk assessment and risk treatment process must be managed by [person responsible for managing the risk assessment process] with expert assistance provided by [person or company responsible for assistance].
7. During the risk assessment, information must be collected through questionnaires and interviews with responsible persons, namely the asset owners across organizational units.
8. The process must be conducted as follows:
   1. All information systems and their owners must be identified.
   2. Threats must be identified for each asset, and corresponding vulnerabilities must be identified for each threat.
   3. Risk owners must be identified for each risk.
   4. Consequences of the loss of confidentiality, integrity, and availability must be evaluated using a score from 0 to 2, with 0 being the lowest rating and 2 being the highest rating.
   5. The likelihood of risk occurrence (i.e., that the threat will exploit the vulnerability) must be evaluated using a score from 0 to 2, with 0 being the lowest rating and 2 being the highest rating.
   6. The level of risk must be calculated by adding up the consequence and likelihood scores.
   7. Risks with a score of 3 or 4 must be determined to be unacceptable risks.
   8. For each unacceptable risk, a risk treatment option must be considered, and appropriate information security controls must be selected.
   9. After controls are applied, residual risks must be assessed.
9. The following documents must be used or generated during the implementation of risk assessment and risk treatment:
   1. **Risk Assessment Table (Appendix A)**: For each combination of systems, vulnerabilities, and threats, this table shows the values for consequence and likelihood, and calculates the risk.
   2. **Risk Treatment Table (Appendix B)**: Defines the options for risk treatment, selection of controls for each unacceptable risk, and the level of residual risk.
